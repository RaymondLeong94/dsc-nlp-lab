    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***Newsgroups Dataset*** is a collection of [newsgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) posts originally collected around 1995. While the backend code implementation is fairly different, you can think of them as like the Reddit posts of 1995, where a \"category\" in this dataset is like a subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to try to identify the category where a post was published, based on the text content of the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what you are practicing here is using the `sklearn.datasets` submodule, which you have seen before (e.g. the Iris Dataset, the Wine Dataset). You can see a full list of available dataset loaders [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will be using the `fetch_20newsgroups` function ([documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups.html)). An important thing to note is that because this is text data, scikit-learn actually downloads a set of documents to the computer you are using to complete this lab, rather than just loading data into memory in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to preprocessing, every row in the dataset only contains one feature: a string containing the full text of the newsgroup post. We will perform preprocessing to create additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed based on the function name, there are 20 categories in the full dataset. Here is a list of all the possible classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='classes.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This full dataset is quite large. To save us from extremely long runtimes, we'll work with only a subset of the classes. For this lab, we'll work with the following five:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'comp.windows.x'`\n",
    "* `'rec.sport.hockey'`\n",
    "* `'misc.forsale'`\n",
    "* `'sci.crypt'`\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas and `sklearn.datasets` to load the train and test data into appropriate data structures. Then get a sense of what is in this dataset by visually inspecting some samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis with `nltk`\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize the case of the data and use a tokenizer to convert the full posts into lists of individual words. Then compare the raw word frequency distributions of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Build and Evaluate a Baseline Model with `TfidfVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately all data must be in numeric form in order to be able to fit a scikit-learn model. So we'll use a tool from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` to convert all data into a vectorized format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we'll keep all of the default parameters for both the vectorizer and the model, in order to develop a baseline score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Iteratively Perform and Evaluate Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will investigate three techniques, to determine whether they should be part of our final modeling process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing stopwords\n",
    "2. Using custom tokens\n",
    "3. Domain-specific feature engineering\n",
    "4. Increasing `max_features`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have chosen a final modeling process, fit it on the full training data and evaluate it on the test data. "
